This data pertains to the San Francisco area from November of 2018 through October of 2019.

I will be using a yearsâ€™ worth of information from the following datasets:

Listings: detailed listings data including full descriptions and average review score
Calendar: detailed calendar data for listings, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
Reviews: detailed review data for listings including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Additionally, I will be referencing rental price information from Zillow

In my analysis, I will be exploring the following:

What makes a good user experience at a Airbnb rental? What makes a poor user experience? What would you advise to new Airbnb hosts to ensure high reviews and consistent renters?
What are some of the seasonal Airbnb trends you've noticed in the San Francisco area? When are the down months over the last year? Which months are the busiest? Which areas were the most popular during these times? How do prices change over time?
Can you create a price predictor for locations in San Francisco based upon time of year?
